## 📊 Project Description

Revenue leakage is one of the silent killers for businesses — money that should be earned but slips through cracks due to billing errors, process inefficiencies, or system glitches.  
This project tackles the problem head-on by:

- Automating the detection of revenue leaks using **SQL data analysis**  
- Applying **GPT-powered root cause analysis** for actionable insights  
- Visualizing findings on a **Power BI dashboard** to empower decision-makers  
- Enabling **real-time monitoring** and alerts to stop leakage early

## 🗃️ Data Source

The project leverages transaction and billing data from:

- Simulated business transaction datasets  
- Synthetic revenue leakage flags generated via SQL queries  
- Anonymized sample data representing customer orders, payments, refunds, and chargebacks  

> *Note:* Dataset is created for demo and learning purposes but can be adapted to real enterprise data with minimal changes.

## 🎮 Analytical Game: Spot the Revenue Leak!

Let's put your skills to the test! Here’s a mini-game:

**You have 5 transactions below. One has a suspiciously missing refund. Can you spot the leakage?**

| Transaction ID | Amount | Refund Status | Comments                  |
|----------------|--------|---------------|---------------------------|
| TXN001         | 2500   | No            | Normal                    |
| TXN002         | 3400   | Yes           | Partial refund processed  |
| TXN003         | 1500   | No            | Customer complaint noted  |
| TXN004         | 4200   | No            | **Potential leak here?**  |
| TXN005         | 2750   | Yes           | Refund fully processed    |

**Hint:** Check transactions with no refunds but customer issues or unusually high amounts.
